## Concept

Do you ever wish that you had a concise list of accessibility funding needs that you could share?
This site aims to provide that list for easy reference.


## Contributing

Relevant PRs to this site are welcome.
This was formerly a gist so there are probably typos and grammatical errors, so edits and additions welcome!


Other ways to contribute:

* Convince other people to fund a11y work.
* Educate folks about the harm of accessibility overlays.
* Become someone who has influence for how your company supports open source initiatives.
