    <h1>Fund Accessibility Work!</h1>

  <main>
    <h2 id="analysis-on-accessibility-project-funding">Analysis on accessibility project funding</h2>
    <p>This analysis is based on my work in the specialization of accessibility (a11y) in web development.
      This document seeks to outline the places where public, open-source work would benefit from funding, and such work
      would also improve the state of a11y across the web.</p>
    <h3 id="areas">Areas</h3>
    <p>Here are some areas that I've identified as potential funding opportunities. For the major initiatives, I've
      outlined what specifically would be useful to fund, and highlighted some rationales for why.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>ARIA documentation</li>
      <li>Education and training</li>
      <li>Developer advocacy</li>
      <li>Automated tooling</li>
      <li>Cross-browser efforts</li>
      <li>Cross-specification efforts (Improved coordination with HTML specification authors)</li>
      <li>JS Frameworks</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In general, a11y is a tricky area to work on for several reasons.
      First, it's not considered as valuable as performance or even CSS, so it is often deprioritized.
      Second, addressing the complexities of accessibility needs often requires a depth of knowledge that is acquired
      over years and often at the expense of other parts of engineering, so collaboration is required.</p>
    <h4 id="area-aria-documentation">Area: ARIA documentation</h4>
    <p><strong>What is needed:</strong> </p>
    <p>Paid positions for a11y experts to focus solely on the improvement of WAI-ARIA documentation.</p>
    <p><strong>How this helps:</strong></p>
    <p>While it's useful to have representation from different companies on the ARIA working group, not everyone has
      paid time during work to ship updates. This means there is always a large backlog of work. By securing positions
      that provide a sole focus on improving documentation, authors will have improved guidance on implementing
      accessible features. I believe that 2-3 people who spend even just 1-2 years on this could make a world of
      difference.</p>
    <h4 id="area-education-and-training">Area: Education and Training</h4>
    <p><strong>What is needed:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Education and training on par with other areas of web development</li>
      <li>Education materials for other specification groups</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How this helps:</strong></p>
    <p>While A11y is sometimes included in other areas of learning (e.g., web.dev has a "Learn Forms!" Course that
      includes accessibility), there is no equivalent accessibility-focused course to the "Learn CSS!" course. While <a
        href="https://web.dev/accessible/">https://web.dev/accessible/</a> does exist, it doesn't provide much depth,
      and can give the false impression that not much needs doing when it comes to accessibility.</p>
    <h3 id="area-developer-advocacy">Area: Developer Advocacy</h3>
    <p><strong>What is needed:</strong></p>
    <p>Developer advocates who can focus on accessibility.</p>
    <p><strong>How this helps:</strong></p>
    <p>It's possible that this folds into the area above. Perhaps ensuring that there are developer advocates for
      accessibility and that they are treated with the same priority and regard as in other areas, is the appropriate
      request here. More thought is needed on the specific ask and whether or not this should combine with other
      categories.</p>
    <h3 id="area-tooling">Area: Tooling</h3>
    <p><strong>What is needed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>More open-source analysis on all success criteria that doesn't have the ulterior motive of selling auditing
        services; as an example, here's an open-source side project that starts to address this: <a
          href="https://a11y-automation.dev/">A11y Automation Tracker</a></li>
      <li>Focused efforts to improve linting in a performant, open-source way (think eslint or ember-template-lint)</li>
      <li>Focused efforts to improve accessibility testing</li>
      <li>Additional tools. Example idea: CLI that allows the developer to "navigate" a site based on only info from the
        CLI, and similar to what a user with a screen-reader experiences</li>
      <li>Test harness for WAI-ARIA spec (add link to issue)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How this helps:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Innovation is inspiring!</li>
      <li>It improves the DX for creating accessible sites/apps</li>
      <li>Sometimes tooling can be open-source code but outside input is not welcome, so additional "competing" products
        can still be useful</li>
    </ul>
